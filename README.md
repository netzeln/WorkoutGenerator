#### _Generates a Interval Workout based on user preferences, February, 2016_

#### By _**Nic Netzel, Torrence Stratton, Molly Curtin, Jared Beckler**_

## Description

_This website generates an interval workout based on user inputs.  The user selects the amount of time (in increments of 5 ranging from 5 - 30 minutes) they would like to workout, and optionally identifies equipment they have available, and/or specific body areas (upper, lower, core, cardio) that they would like to focus on.  The site semi randomly chooses exercises that fit the users input and displays them in sets of 5 exercises. In addition to explaining how to perform the exercises it also explains the pattern to follow and provides an animated gif timer to show 20 seconds of exertion and 10 seconds of rest._

## Setup/Installation Requirements
